### About Content Aggregator
In the world of Data Science, content and data is everything. Every website, blog or social media application like Facebook, Instagram is filled with enormous amount of content and data. So what Content Aggregators actually do is that it fetches particular information or content all over the internet and aggregates that content at the one place. In simple words it saves your time of searching some information on different websites because it shows all the information you need from different source at one place.
You can develop content aggregator for different fields separately like a news aggregator where you will fetch all the latest news from all the leading news outlets in your region or country into one place.
